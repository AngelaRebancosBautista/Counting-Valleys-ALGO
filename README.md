# Counting-Valleys-ALGO

/This program counts the number of valleys a hiker traverses during a hike, where a valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level starting with a step down and ending with a step up to sea level. It updates the sea level for each step and increments the valley count each time the hiker comes up to sea level from below.
